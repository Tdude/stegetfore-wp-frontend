# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the dark mode implementation for the WordPress-fed frontend application. While the basic dark mode functionality (theme context, toggle button) is working, the color scheme needs to be more coherent and consistent across all components. The goal is to ensure proper contrast, readability, and visual harmony in dark mode while maintaining the existing light mode design.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent dark mode colors across all components, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN all components SHALL use consistent background colors from the design system
2. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN all text colors SHALL provide adequate contrast ratios (WCAG AA compliance)
3. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN all interactive elements SHALL have consistent hover and focus states
4. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN all borders and dividers SHALL use consistent colors from the dark theme palette

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper dark mode styling for form components, so that forms are readable and usable in dark mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN form inputs SHALL have dark backgrounds with light text
2. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN form labels SHALL be clearly visible with proper contrast
3. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN form validation messages SHALL be readable in dark mode
4. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN form containers and panels SHALL use consistent dark backgrounds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper dark mode styling for navigation components, so that I can easily navigate the site in dark mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN the header SHALL have a dark background with light text
2. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN navigation dropdowns SHALL use dark backgrounds with proper contrast
3. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN the footer SHALL maintain readability with appropriate dark styling
4. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN navigation hover states SHALL be clearly visible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper dark mode styling for content modules, so that all page content is readable in dark mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN hero modules SHALL adapt their overlay and text colors appropriately
2. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN text modules SHALL use dark backgrounds with light text
3. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN CTA modules SHALL maintain visual hierarchy in dark mode
4. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN card components SHALL use consistent dark styling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper dark mode styling for UI components, so that all interface elements work well in dark mode.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN buttons SHALL maintain their visual hierarchy with appropriate dark mode colors
2. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN cards SHALL use consistent dark backgrounds and borders
3. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN modals and overlays SHALL use appropriate dark styling
4. WHEN dark mode is enabled THEN loading states and animations SHALL be visible in dark mode

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a coherent CSS architecture for dark mode, so that future components can easily implement consistent dark mode styling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new components THEN developers SHALL have clear CSS custom properties for dark mode colors
2. WHEN implementing new components THEN developers SHALL have utility classes for common dark mode patterns
3. WHEN implementing new components THEN the CSS architecture SHALL prevent inconsistent color usage
4. WHEN reviewing code THEN dark mode implementations SHALL follow established patterns and conventions
