# Dark Mode Testing Report

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing performed on the dark mode implementation across the application. The testing focuses on three key areas:

1. Theme toggle functionality
2. Contrast ratios for accessibility
3. Consistency of dark mode styling across components

## Testing Tools

We've created two testing tools to assist with dark mode testing:

1. **dark-mode-test.js**: A JavaScript utility that provides functions for testing theme toggle functionality, contrast ratios, and styling consistency.
2. **dark-mode-test.html**: A standalone HTML page that allows for visual inspection and running the test utilities in a browser environment.

## Testing Process

### 1. Theme Toggle Testing

The theme toggle functionality was tested to ensure:

- The theme context is properly initialized
- The theme toggle button correctly switches between light and dark modes
- The theme state is persisted in localStorage
- The theme toggle is accessible and properly labeled

**Test Steps:**
1. Check initial theme state
2. Click theme toggle button
3. Verify theme has changed
4. Click theme toggle button again
5. Verify theme has returned to original state

### 2. Contrast Ratio Testing

Contrast ratios were tested to ensure WCAG AA compliance (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text):

- Text colors against background colors
- Button text against button backgrounds
- Form input text against input backgrounds
- Navigation links against header/footer backgrounds

**Test Steps:**
1. For each component, extract foreground and background colors
2. Calculate contrast ratio using WCAG formula
3. Compare against minimum requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
4. Flag any components that fail to meet requirements

### 3. Consistency Testing

Styling consistency was tested to ensure:

- Consistent background colors for similar components
- Consistent text colors for headings and paragraphs
- Consistent border colors
- Proper hover and focus states for interactive elements

**Test Steps:**
1. Switch to dark mode
2. Check background colors across similar components
3. Check text colors across headings and paragraphs
4. Check border colors across components
5. Test hover and focus states for interactive elements

## Test Results

### Theme Toggle Functionality

✅ **PASSED**

- Theme toggle button correctly switches between light and dark modes
- Theme state is properly persisted in localStorage
- Theme toggle is accessible with proper aria-label

### Contrast Ratios

⚠️ **PARTIAL PASS**

Most components meet WCAG AA requirements, but some issues were identified:

- **HeroModule**: Text contrast against image backgrounds needs improvement in dark mode
- **CTAModule**: Button text contrast needs improvement in dark mode
- **Form inputs**: Some form inputs have insufficient contrast in dark mode

### Styling Consistency

⚠️ **PARTIAL PASS**

Most components use consistent styling, but some inconsistencies were found:

- **Background colors**: Some components use hardcoded background colors instead of semantic CSS variables
- **Border colors**: Inconsistent border colors in card components
- **Hover states**: Some interactive elements lack proper hover states in dark mode

## Recommendations

Based on the test results, the following improvements are recommended:

1. **HeroModule Improvements**:
   - Increase overlay opacity in dark mode for better text contrast
   - Use semantic color variables instead of hardcoded colors
   - Ensure hero text has sufficient contrast against all background types

2. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Standardize hover and focus states for all interactive elements
   - Ensure all buttons use semantic color variables
   - Add focus rings that are visible in dark mode

3. **Border Consistency**:
   - Use semantic border color variables consistently
   - Ensure all dividers and borders follow the same color scheme
   - Update card components to use consistent border styling

## Next Steps

1. Address the issues identified in the HeroModule component
2. Fix any remaining inconsistencies in interactive elements
3. Ensure all components use semantic color variables
4. Re-run tests after fixes to verify improvements

## Conclusion

The dark mode implementation is generally working well, but there are specific areas that need improvement to ensure full accessibility and visual consistency. By addressing the recommendations outlined in this report, we can achieve a more coherent and accessible dark mode experience across the application.
